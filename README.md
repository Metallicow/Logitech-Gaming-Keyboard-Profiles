Collection of application macros I have created for different apps over the years for some of the more popular apps.
Each profile is setup with the application/games default Keyboard shortcuts.
Note you might have to modify the application exe path.
Most of the profile paths are default install paths for Windows XP Pro 32Bit.

Most where made with a G11 Gaming Keyboard and the newer gaming software, Not the legacy version.
The newer files extension is .xml
The legacy files extension is .lgp

These profiles might work with other versions of the keyboard/software also.
Also a later version of an application will probably still have the same default hotkeys.

Feel free to send a Pull Request for any applications you may have layed out for your particular keyboard if you happen to have one that isn't here.
